			 <p>Lectures are a key feature of university teaching. In broad terms, the principal purpose of a lecture is to provide you with information in an efficient, well-structured way. More particularly, lectures present information and research on specific topics, highlight areas of importance and interest within the topic, work through some of the areas you are likely to find confusing. Before the lectures, make sure that you have enough paper, pens/pencils for note taking or any other equipment that you may need. During lecture what you decide to note and in how much detail, will depend on the context.</p>

			<h3 class="subHeadings2">Tutorials</h3>

			 <p> Tutorials are meetings of smaller groups of students to discuss specific topics related to the subject matter of the course. The key focus of tutorial groups is the interactive, participatory nature of the discussion. Tutorial discussions rely for their success on what you do before and during a tutorial. Before the tutorials, read the required articles or chapters as set out for your tutorial topic in your subject guide.</p>

			<h3 class="subHeadings2">Laboratory Practicals</h3>

			 <p>Practical provides the opportunity for students to observe and manipulate materials and give insight into scientific methods and processes as well as scientific knowledge. Before the practical, complete any required reading and ensure you have any necessary equipment necessary. After the practical, write up the results of your laboratory or practical session as soon as possible. This will ensure that what you did in the session will still be fresh in your mind.</p>

			  <p> Making yourself familiar with the topic before attending the lecture is a very useful way of ensuring that you get the most out of the lecture. It is useful to read these before the lecture so that you are familiar with the topic that will be covered. If the lecturer invites questions at the end of the lecture, consider what else you might need to know to have a more thorough understanding of the topic.</p>

			<p> Your presentation should consider the needs of the audience and what you want them to gain from it. The presentation must also contain an identifiable introduction, body and conclusion.</p>

			 <p>In the case of seminars where you, as the presenter of the paper, must lead the discussion more forcefully than in a tutorial, you will be expected to seek out questions actively from your audience and maintain control of the discussion. </p>

			<h3 class="subHeadings2">Review</h3>

			 <p>After your tutorial is finished it is essential that you take some time to review your tutorial session or seminar. This will help you when you come to finish writing up the written version of your presentation. </p>

			<p> For internal students, it is very important to attend lectures.  Lecturers will generally give an overview of the day’s topic, relate it to previous topics, and indicate important points, readings, debates and issues for you to consider. This is where you can extend your understanding of the topic, become aware of the lecturer’s perspective and emphasis and make notes of the important aspects of the lecture. You need to prepare before you attend the lecture, pay attention during the lecture and revise the lecture content afterwards.</p>
