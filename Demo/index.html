			<p> For internal students, it is very important to attend lectures.  Lecturers will generally give an overview of the day’s topic, relate it to previous topics, and indicate important points, readings, debates and issues for you to consider. This is where you can extend your understanding of the topic, become aware of the lecturer’s perspective and emphasis and make notes of the important aspects of the lecture. You need to prepare before you attend the lecture, pay attention during the lecture and revise the lecture content afterwards.</p>

			<h3 class="subHeadings2">Tutorials</h3>
			<p> Tutorials are meetings of smaller groups of students to discuss specific topics related to the subject matter of the course. The key focus of tutorial groups is the interactive, participatory nature of the discussion. Tutorial discussions rely for their success on what you do before and during a tutorial.</p>
      <p>Before the tutorials, read the required articles or chapters as set out for your tutorial topic in your subject guide. think about the topic and formulate some basic ideas that you can contribute to the tutorial discussion about the topic.</p>
      <p>During the tutorial, listen to other tutorial participants and contribute your ideas to the discussion. Ask questions. Do not leave the tutorial feeling confused.</p>
      <p>After the tutorial, write down any notes of comments or ideas that you think are important to remember. Add these to your other subject notes.</p>
